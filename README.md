# clj-projectr

A Clojure virtual reality simulation prototype. Currently both generating
`src/clj_projectr/world.clj` (in the future simulating) the data and consuming
it with libgdx `src/clj_projectr/core.clj`. Use `lein run` to execute.

A motivational essay and presentation can be found `doc/`.
